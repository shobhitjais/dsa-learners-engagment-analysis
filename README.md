## 📊 DSA Learner Engagement Analysis (Internship Project)

### 📌 Problem Statement
The tech and academic teams required insights into learner engagement with DSA problems
across multiple monthly batches (July, September, November, December).
The goal was to understand how many questions learners attempted
and how engagement varied across batches.

### 🎯 Business Questions
- How many DSA questions were attempted in each batch?
- Which batches showed higher or lower learner engagement?
- What trends can be observed across different months?

### 🔄 Approach
- Cleaned and transformed raw learner attempt data using Excel Power Query
- Aggregated batch-wise metrics using pivot tables
- Built an interactive dashboard for batch comparison
- Shared the dashboard with stakeholders using Google Sheets

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables)
- Google Sheets (Collaborative sharing)

### 📈 Impact
- Improved visibility into learner problem-solving behavior
- Reduced manual reporting for tech and management teams
- Enabled faster, data-driven decision-making
